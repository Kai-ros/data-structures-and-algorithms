# Challenge Summary
Find common values in 2 binary trees.

## Challenge Description
* Write a function called ```tree_intersection``` that takes two binary tree parameters.
* Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Approach & Efficiency
I think I found as optimal of a solution as there could be given the requirements.
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

## Solution
* [Tree Intersection Source Code](../hashtable/src/main/java/hashtable/TreeIntersection.java)
