# Data Structures & Algorithms File Structure for Code 401: Java

This repo shows the expected file structure for Code 401: Java data structures & algorithms. The command `gradle init --type java-library` was run inside of the `code401challenges` directory, and that `code401challenges` directory is the root from which I open IntelliJ.

This root README is where the links to daily work should live.
